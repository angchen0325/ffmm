ffmm: Fast FMM Solver
=====================

**ffmm**: (*Fast Fourier Modal Method*) is an open source Python package of fast Fourier Modal Method (FMM) solvers 
for both academic and industrial applications. 
We will introduce the mathematical derivation of FMM step by step, and explain the acceleration principle of each step, 
so that everyone, whether from academia or industry, can use this software package to customize their own **ffmm** solver.
