Introduction
============

**ffmm** is a python implementation of fast Fourier Modal Method (FMM).
As periodic photonic structures, such as crystals, are becoming more and more important in many applications, 
FMM has become a popular tool for solving problems related to these structures.
For acedamic purposes, :math: `S^4` is a popular choice for the FMM.
